### Project Description
[Blood Hub is an emergency blood matching web application that connects donors and receivers quickly and efficiently. Users can register as donors, and receivers can instantly find matching blood groups based on location. The platform includes a Rare Blood Group Priority Network and emergency service options like ambulance and rapid bike support, ensuring faster response during critical situations and helping save lives]

### The Problem statement
[During medical emergencies, finding the right blood donor quickly is a major challenge, especially for rare blood groups. Lack of a centralized, fast, and reliable system causes delays that can risk lives. There is a need for a smart digital platform that connects donors and receivers instantly and ensures rapid emergency response support.]


### The Solution
[We solve this problem by creating **Blood Hub**, a smart web-based platform that instantly connects donors and receivers. Donors can register with their blood group, location, and health details, while receivers can quickly search and find matching donors.

The system includes a **Rare Blood Group Priority Network** for urgent cases and provides emergency support options like **ambulance and rapid bike services** to ensure faster response time.

By combining real-time matching, priority alerts, and quick service options, Blood Hub helps reduce delays and save lives during critical situations.]
