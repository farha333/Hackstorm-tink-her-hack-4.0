### Project Description
[A Blood donation website is a platform that connects Blood donors with patients and hospitals in real time.It allows users to register as donors,search for required blood groups nearby,and requests emergency support quickly.The goal is to save lives by making blood availability faster,easier and location based.]

### The Problem statement
[In emergencies,finding the required blood group quickly is difficult and time consuming.There is no fast,location based system to connect nearby blood donors with patients in urgent need.]

### The Solution
[Develop a simple,location-based blood donation website that connects nearby donors with patients in real time .users can search by blood group ,view available donors and connect them quickly during emergencies ]6
